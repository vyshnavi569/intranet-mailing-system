# intranet-mailing-system
This system facilitates mailing among users of an Intranet. Now-a-days organizations are growing fast and are increasing in size also. So, these organizations are divided into departments. In the fast-growing world the information is needed as fast as possible. This can be accomplished by passing the information quickly. Quick passing of mails is not possible in manual systems. This is because the information is passed through persons of one department to another department. This leads to the inconsistency and delay in delivering information. So, we need a system which is both quick and accurate. This can be achieved by developing an Intranet Mailing System
